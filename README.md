# Archer_C7v2_Sniffer_image
Enable TP-Link C7v2 image with needed tool for Wireless Sniffer usage.
Here we use the Lede with customized tool/driver/firmware for TP-Link Archer C7 v2.

The current verified AP is only C7 version 2.(Version 3/4 is not tested)
With the image, you can set command on your own to enable Sinffer function.
Or you can also use my the other python project to complete all the stuff.
